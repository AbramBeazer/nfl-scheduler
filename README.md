#nfl-scheduler

Completed:
 - All 272 matchups are scheduled.
 - Correct logic for determining matchups between divisions.


To-Do:
 - Schedule all matchups into an 18-week schedule, with a bye week somewhere in the middle of each team's schedule.
 - Schedule each week's games by date and time; Thursday night, Monday night, Sunday in various timeslots.
 - Handle exceptions to the above scheduling for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's holidays.
 - Figure out exceptions to NFL scheduling -- For some reason, the AFC North vs. NFC West matchup this year has an irregular home/away structure. Instead of the top two teams in one division playing the other top two at home while playing the bottom two on the road, and vice versa, the #3 Steelers face the #2 Seahawks and #3 Rams on the road, but face the #1 49ers and #4 Cardinals at home. I know that, in the past, the home/away matchups have been adjusted so that teams don't have to fly coast-to-coast too many times in a season. I think this is kinda silly since it's only a three-hour time difference, but my schedule will differ from the official NFL schedule until I figure this out.
 - Keep the same matchup from occurring on consecutive weeks
 - If possible, let teams play on Thursday night only after their bye week, and never let one team play on Monday and Thursday of the same week.
 - Account for games played in Europe -- maybe one team gets a bye before playing in London, and the other team just stays in London and plays another team there the next week? I think that's what the Jaguars are doing in 2023.
